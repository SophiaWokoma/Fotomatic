# Fotomatic
This is a Codeacademy project for the front-end engineering path
# Description
In this project you will fix a broken version of a responsive website called Fotomatic. You will update it to look and work exactly the same as the specs (https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/capstone-1/specs/fotomatic_spec_landing.png) do. As you fix Fotomatic’s bugs, remember to use the skills you acquired in the Chrome DevTools article to help you decipher and update the site’s CSS. Chrome DevTools are essential for debugging – they allow you to view current style values, toggle rules, and test different rule values.
# My Changes
All the changes I made can be found in index.html and style.css files. Index.html file is available inside the repository whereas you can fins the css file in resources -> css -> style.css.  I have added comments in the file to highlight any changes I have made and how it will affect the page.
